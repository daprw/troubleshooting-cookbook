# Troubleshooting Cookbook
This document serves as a collection of methodologies, tools, and just interesting issues I have encountered throughout my career as a self taught tech person. The goal is to try and document any interesting issues I have run into, along with how I approached troubleshooting them. Even if I didn't quite solve an issue I think it would be interesting to have it documented here. I will also include general information like tools I have picked up from working at different places that help me troubleshoot issues.

Please forgive the randomness of this document.
